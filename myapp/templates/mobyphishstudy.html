      <h1>Our Study Project</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Empowering End-Users Against PKI Vulnerabilities: A User-Centric Approach is an NSF funded, IRB approved joint research project with University of Connecticut and Trinity College. This usability study tests the effectiveness of our extension, MobyPhish, in empowering users to identify and mitigate phishing attacks.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">To collect data that provides meaningful insights about user behavior, our study has three stages. The first stage is a short-term study, where participants come into our labs and complete tasks with and without MobyPhish’s help.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Participants who finished the short-term study will have the opportunity to participate in our long-term study, the second stage of the usability study. During the long-term study participants will download MobyPhish to their personal computer and use it in their daily lives. In addition to this, they will complete 10 groups of tasks, similar to those in the short-study.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Finally, if participants complete both short and long-term studies, they can participate in an exit study. This last stage allows participants to provide information about their experience with MobyPhish in a longer format.</p>
